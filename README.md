# Project3-New South Waves
This is the final project completed as part of a Software Engineer Immersive course at GA Sydney. The purpose of this project was to build a web application from scratch, based on React/Node.js knowledge along with MongoDB.

'New South Waves' is a web application where you can book surfing product as well as some beach product you would need. Users can also sign up and browse the available products, or get information about the animal rescue centres.
